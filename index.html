                <li><strong>1914</strong> -  Nazrul Islam studied in the Darirampur School (now Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University) in Trishal, Mymensingh District.</li>
                <li><strong>1917</strong> - Joined the British Indian Army at the age of eighteen instead of appearing for the matriculation pre-test examination. </li>
                <li><strong>1919</strong> - First prose work, "Life of a Vagabond" ('Baunduler Atmakahini), was published</li>
                <li><strong>1920</strong> - Left the British Indian army. He published his first novel Bandhan-hara ('Freedom from Bondage').</li>
                <li><strong>1921</strong> -  Nazrul Islam was engaged to Nargis, the niece of a well-known Muslim publisher, Ali Akbar Khan, in Daulatpur, Comilla.[44] On 18 June 1921, the day of the wedding, upon public insistence by Khan that the term "Nazrul must reside in Daulatpur after marriage" be included in the marriage contract, Nazrul Islam walked away from the wedding ceremony.</li>
                <li><strong>1922</strong> - Nazrul Islam reached the peak of his fame in 1922 with Bidrohi (The Rebel), which remains his most famous work, winning the admiration of India's literary society for his description of a rebel.  He followed up by writing Pralayollas ('Destructive Euphoria'), and his first anthology of poems, the Agni-veena which enjoyed commercial and critical success. He also published a volume of short stories, the Byathar Dan "ব্যথার দান" ('Gift of Sorrow'), and Yugbani ("যুগবাণী"), an anthology of essays. Nazrul Islam started a bi-weekly magazine, Dhumketu ("ধূমকেতু", 'Comet') on 12 August 1922 that was critical of the British Empire.Earning the moniker of the "rebel poet", Nazrul Islam aroused the suspicion of British Raj authorities. The Police raided the office of Dhumketu after it published "Anondomoyeer Agomone" ("আনন্দময়ীর আগমনে"), a political poem, in September 1922.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1923</strong> -  Nazrul Islam was arrested on 23 January 1923 and charged with sedition. He presented a long argument in the court, an excerpt of what he said: <br>

                    I have been accused of sedition... To plead for me, the king of all kings, the judge of all judges, the eternal truth the living God... I am a poet; I have been sent by God to express the unexpressed, to portray the unportrayed. It is God who is heard through the voice of the poet... I am an instrument of God. The instrument is not unbreakable, but who is there to break God?</li>

                    <li><strong>1928</strong> - Nazrul Islam began working as a lyricist, composer, and music director for His Master's Voice Gramophone Company.Nazrul Islam's mother died in 1928, and his second son, Bulbul, died of smallpox the following year.</li>

                    <li><strong>1941</strong> - On hearing about the death of Rabindranath Tagore on 8 August 1941, a shocked Nazrul Islam composed two poems in Tagore's memory. Within months, Nazrul Islam himself fell ill and gradually began losing his power of speech. His behaviour became erratic, he started spending recklessly and fell into financial difficulties. However, Nazrul Islam's health had seriously deteriorated and he grew increasingly depressed. He received treatment under homeopathy as well as Ayurveda, but little progress was achieved before mental dysfunction intensified and he was admitted to a mental asylum in 1942. Spending four months there without making progress, Nazrul Islam and his family began living a quiet life in India.</li>
                    <li><strong>1952</strong> - he was transferred to a psychiatric hospital in Ranchi.</li>
